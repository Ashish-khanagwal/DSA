# Problem -> Remove Element

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode - Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

---

## Intuition

The problem asks us to remove all occurrences of a given value `val` from the array `nums` **in-place**, and return the new length of the array after removal.  
Since the order of elements can be changed, but we donâ€™t need to return the modified array itself (only the valid length), we can solve this efficiently using a **two-pointer approach**.

---

## Approach

1. Use a pointer `l` that tracks the position where the next valid (non-`val`) element should go.
2. Iterate through the array with index `i`:
   - If `nums[i] != val`, copy it to `nums[l]` and increment `l`.
   - If `nums[i] == val`, simply skip it.
3. After processing, `l` will represent the new length of the array without the removed elements.
4. Since modification happens **in-place**, no extra array is used.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$  
  We traverse the array once.

- **Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$  
  No extra space is used apart from pointers.

## Code

```python3
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        l = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != val:
                nums[l] = nums[i]
                l += 1
        return l
```
