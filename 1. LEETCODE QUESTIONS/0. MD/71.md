# Intuition

When going through a list of words, consecutive words that are **anagrams** of each other should be removed — keeping only the **first occurrence**.  
The intuition is to compare each word with the previous one:

- If they are anagrams, remove the current word.
- If not, move to the next word.

Anagrams have the same character frequency — so we can detect them by comparing frequency counts.

# Approach

1. **Define an anagram-checking helper (`isAnagram`)**:
   - Convert both words to lowercase for consistency.
   - If lengths differ, return `False` immediately.
   - Count character frequencies for both strings:
     - Increment count for each character in `s`.
     - Decrement for each in `t`.
   - If all frequency values end up being zero → they are anagrams.
2. **Iterate through the list (`words`) starting from the second element (`i = 1`):**
   - Compare the current word with the previous one using `isAnagram`.
   - If they are anagrams, remove the current word using `del words[i]` (don’t increment `i` because the next word shifts left).
   - If not, move to the next index (`i += 1`).
3. **Return the filtered list** after the iteration.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n \cdot k)$$
  - `n` → number of words, `k` → average length of each word.
  - Each pair comparison takes $$O(k)$$ time for counting characters.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$
  - Only uses a small frequency dictionary for each comparison (no extra data structures for storage).

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def removeAnagrams(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        def isAnagram(s, t):
            s, t = s.lower(), t.lower()
            if len(s) != len(t):
                return False

            freq = {}
            for ch in s:
                freq[ch] = freq.get(ch, 0) + 1
            for ch in t:
                freq[ch] = freq.get(ch, 0) - 1

            return all(v == 0 for v in freq.values())

        i = 1
        while i < len(words):
            anagram = isAnagram(words[i - 1], words[i])
            if anagram:
                del words[i]
            else:
                i += 1
        return words

```
