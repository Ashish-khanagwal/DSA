# Problem -> Ransom Note

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode - Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/)

---

## Intuition

To construct the ransom note, we must check whether every character in the note exists in the magazine **with enough frequency**.  
If at any point a required character is missing or insufficient, the ransom note cannot be constructed.

---

## Approach

1. Use a **hashmap (dictionary)** to count the frequency of each character in `magazine`.
2. Iterate through each character in `ransomNote`:
   - If the character does not exist in the hashmap, or its count is zero, return `False`.
   - Otherwise, decrement its frequency in the hashmap.
3. If all characters are checked successfully, return `True`.

---

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(m + n)$$
  - `m` = length of `magazine` (for counting frequencies)
  - `n` = length of `ransomNote` (for validation)

- **Space Complexity:** $$O(k)$$
  - Where `k` is the number of distinct characters in `magazine`.

## Code

```python3
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        hashmap = {}
        for ch in magazine:
            hashmap[ch] = hashmap.get(ch, 0) + 1

        for ch in ransomNote:
            if ch not in hashmap or hashmap[ch] == 0:
                return False
            hashmap[ch] -= 1
        return True

```
