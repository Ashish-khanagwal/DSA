# Merge Strings Alternately

## Intuition

We need to merge two strings `word1` and `word2` by alternating characters:

- Take one character from `word1`, then one from `word2`, and repeat.
- If one string is longer, append the remaining characters at the end.

This problem is straightforward â€” we just need to keep track of indices for both strings while merging.

---

## Approach

1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` for `word1` and `word2`.
2. Create an empty list `merged` to build the result.
3. While either pointer is within its string:
   - If `i < len(word1)`, append `word1[i]` and increment `i`.
   - If `j < len(word2)`, append `word2[j]` and increment `j`.
4. Join the `merged` list into a final string and return it.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity:** O(n + m), where `n = len(word1)` and `m = len(word2)`.
- **Space complexity:** O(n + m), for storing the merged result.

## Code

```
def mergeAlternately(word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
    i = j = 0
    merged = []

    while i < len(word1) or j < len(word2):
        if i < len(word1):
            merged.append(word1[i])
            i += 1
        if j < len(word2):
            merged.append(word2[j])
            j += 1
    return "".join(merged)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(mergeAlternately("abc", "pqr"))   # Output: "apbqcr"
    print(mergeAlternately("ab", "pqrs"))   # Output: "apbqrs"
    print(merge
```
