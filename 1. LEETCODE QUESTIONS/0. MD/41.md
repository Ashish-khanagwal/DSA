# First Letter to Appear Twice (LeetCode 2351)

---

## Intuition

We need to find the first character in the string that appears twice.  
The simplest way to do this is to keep track of all characters weâ€™ve seen so far.

- As soon as we see a character that already exists in our set, we return it.

This ensures that the **first duplicate** is returned immediately.

---

## Approach

1. Initialize an empty set `seen`.
2. Traverse through each character in the string `s`:
   - If the character is already in `seen`, return it immediately.
   - Otherwise, add it to `seen`.
3. Since the problem guarantees there will always be a character that appears twice, we donâ€™t need an extra return at the end.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$  
  Each character is checked once, and set operations are $$O(1)$$ on average.

- **Space complexity:** $$O(n)$$  
  At most, we store all unique characters in the set.

## Code

```python3
class Solution:
    def repeatedCharacter(self, s: str) -> str:
        seen = set()
        for i in s:
            if i in seen:
                return i
            else:
                seen.add(i)
```
