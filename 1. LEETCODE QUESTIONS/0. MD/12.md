# Intuition

We need to find the number in the array that is closest to zero.

- Naturally, we should compare numbers by their absolute values.
- If two numbers are equally close (like -2 and 2), the positive one should be chosen.

# Approach

1. Start with the first element as `closest`.
2. Iterate through each number in `nums:`

- If the absolute value of the current number is smaller than `abs(closest)`, update `closest`.

3. After the loop, check if `closest` is negative and its positive counterpart exists in the array â†’ return the positive version (since the problem prefers positive on ties).
4. Otherwise, return `closest`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
  We iterate over the list once.

- Space complexity: O(1)
  Only a variable to keep track of the closest value.

# Code

```
class Solution:
    def findClosestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        closest = nums[0]
        for i in nums:
            if abs(i) < abs(closest):
                closest = i

        if closest < 0 and abs(closest) in nums:
            return abs(closest)
        else:
            return closest
```
