# Intuition

The list `nums` contains integers from `0` to `n - 1`, but two numbers appear twice.  
To find these two “sneaky” numbers, we can leverage mathematical relationships between the **sum** and **sum of squares** of numbers in a normal range and compare them to the given list.

# Approach

1. Let the two repeated numbers be `a` and `b`.
2. Compute:
   - `sum_nums` → the sum of all numbers in `nums`.
   - `sum_sq` → the sum of squares of all numbers in `nums`.
3. The expected sums for a perfect list of `0` to `n - 1` are:
   - `expected_sum = n * (n - 1) / 2`
   - `expected_sq_sum = (n - 1) * n * (2n - 1) / 6`
4. From the differences:
   - `x = sum_nums - expected_sum = a + b`
   - `y = sum_sq - expected_sq_sum = a² + b²`
5. Using these, form the equation:
   - `a * b = (x² - y) / 2`
6. Solve the quadratic equation:
   - `t² - x*t + ab = 0`
   - Using the quadratic formula, find the two values `a` and `b`.
7. Return the two numbers in ascending order.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — single traversal to compute sums.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$ — uses constant extra space.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def getSneakyNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums) - 2
        sum_nums = sum(nums)
        sum_sq = sum(x * x for x in nums)

        expected_sum = n * (n - 1) // 2
        expected_sq_sum = (n - 1) * n * (2 * n - 1) // 6

        x = sum_nums - expected_sum      # a + b
        y = sum_sq - expected_sq_sum     # a² + b²

        ab = ((x * x) - y) // 2          # a * b

        import math
        a = (x + math.isqrt(x * x - 4 * ab)) // 2
        b = x - a

        return [b, a]
```
