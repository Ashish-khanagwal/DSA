# Intuition

We need to determine if each number in the array occurs a **unique number of times**.  
So, if two or more numbers share the same frequency, the answer should be `False`; otherwise, `True`.

---

# Approach

1. Use a `Counter` to count the frequency of each number in the array.
2. Iterate over all frequency values:
   - Keep a set to store the frequencies we’ve already seen.
   - If a frequency appears again (i.e., already in the set), return `False`.
3. If no duplicates are found among frequencies, return `True`.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — Counting elements and checking uniqueness both take linear time.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — Extra space is used for the counter and the set.

# Code

```python3 []
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        counter = Counter(arr)
        s = set()

        for v in counter.values():
            if v in s:
                return False
            else:
                s.add(v)
        return True

```
