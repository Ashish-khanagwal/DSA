# Find Closest Person

## Intuition

We are given three people on a number line:

- Person 1 at position `x`
- Person 2 at position `y`
- Person 3 at position `z` (stationary)

Both Person 1 and Person 2 move toward Person 3 at the same speed.  
To find who reaches first, we only need to compare their distances from `z`.

---

## Approach

1. Calculate distance of Person 1 from Person 3 → `abs(x - z)`.
2. Calculate distance of Person 2 from Person 3 → `abs(y - z)`.
3. Compare distances:
   - If Person 1 is closer, return `1`.
   - If Person 2 is closer, return `2`.
   - If both are equally close, return `0`.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity:** O(1), only arithmetic operations.
- **Space complexity:** O(1), no extra space used.

## Code

```
def findClosest(x: int, y: int, z: int) -> int:
    dxz = x - z
    dyz = y - z
    if abs(dxz) > abs(dyz):
        return 2
    elif abs(dxz) < abs(dyz):
        return 1
    else:
        return 0


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(findClosest(2, 7, 4))  # Output: 1
    print(findClosest(2, 5, 6))  # Output: 2
    print(findClosest(1, 5, 3))  # Output: 0
```
