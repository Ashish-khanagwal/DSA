# Problem -> Jewels and Stones

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode - Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)

---

## Intuition

We need to count how many stones are also jewels.  
A natural approach is to check each stone against the set of jewels. Using a set for jewels makes the check efficient.

---

## Approach

1. Convert `jewels` string into a **set** for O(1) lookup.
2. Initialize a counter `num_of_jewels = 0`.
3. Iterate through each stone in `stones`:
   - If the stone is in the `jewels` set, increment the counter.
4. Return the counter after checking all stones.

---

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(m + n)$$
  - `m` = length of `jewels` (for creating the set)
  - `n` = length of `stones` (for iterating and checking each stone)

- **Space Complexity:** $$O(m)$$
  - For storing the jewels in a set.

## Code

```python3
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        jewels = set(jewels)
        num_of_jewels = 0

        for s in stones:
            if s in jewels:
                num_of_jewels += 1
        return num_of_jewels

```
