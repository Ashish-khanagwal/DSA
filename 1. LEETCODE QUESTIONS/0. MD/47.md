# Problem -> Move Zeroes

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode - Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

---

## Intuition

We need to move all zeroes in the array to the end while keeping the relative order of non-zero elements the same.  
A naive approach could involve creating a new array and copying elements, but the problem specifically requires **in-place modification**.  
Thus, a **two-pointer technique** works best here.

---

## Approach

1. Initialize a pointer `l = 0` that tracks where the next non-zero element should be placed.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If `nums[i] != 0`, place it at `nums[l]` and increment `l`.
3. After placing all non-zero elements, fill the remaining positions from `l` to the end of the array with `0`.

This ensures that all non-zero elements maintain their relative order, and all zeroes are shifted to the end.

---

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$  
  We traverse the list twice â€” once to move non-zero elements and once to place zeroes.

- **Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$  
  In-place modification, no extra data structure used.

## Code

```python3
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        l = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != 0:
                nums[l] = nums[i]
                l += 1
        for i in range(l, len(nums)):
            nums[i] = 0

```
