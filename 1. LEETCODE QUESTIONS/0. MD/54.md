# Problem -> Valid Triangle Number

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode - Valid Triangle Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-triangle-number/)

## Intuition

To form a triangle with three sides, the **sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side**.  
Given a sorted array, for each potential largest side `nums[k]`, we can find pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` efficiently that satisfy the triangle inequality.

---

## Approach

1. **Sort** the array in ascending order.
2. Iterate `k` from the end of the array to index `2` (as the largest side).
3. Use a **two-pointer approach** for the first two sides:
   - Initialize `i = 0` and `j = k - 1`.
   - While `i < j`:
     - If `nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]`:
       - All pairs `(i, i+1, ..., j-1, j)` satisfy the condition.
       - Increment `count` by `j - i`.
       - Move `j` leftward (`j -= 1`).
     - Else:
       - Move `i` rightward (`i += 1`).
4. Return the total `count`.

This works efficiently because sorting allows us to know that increasing `i` or decreasing `j` preserves the triangle inequality property.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n^2)$$
  - Sorting takes $$O(n \log n)$$, and the two-pointer iteration for each `k` takes $$O(n^2)$$ in total.

- **Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$
  - Only a few variables are used; no extra data structures proportional to `n`.

## Code

```python3
class Solution:
    def triangleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        count = 0

        for k in range(n-1, 1, -1):
            i = 0
            j = k - 1
            while i < j:
                if nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]:
                    count += (j - i)
                    j -= 1
                else:
                    i += 1
        return count

```
