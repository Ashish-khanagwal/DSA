# Intuition

The problem asks for the total number of elements that have the **highest frequency** in the array.  
The key idea is to count how many times each number appears and then find how many occurrences correspond to the maximum frequency.

# Approach

1. Use a `Counter` to calculate the frequency of each element in `nums`.
2. Find the **maximum frequency** among all elements.
3. Sum the frequencies of all elements that occur exactly `max_freq` times.
   - This ensures we count all elements contributing to the most frequent occurrences.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — we traverse the list once to count frequencies and once to compute the sum.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — for storing frequencies in the hash map.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def maxFrequencyElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        freq = Counter(nums)
        max_freq = max(freq.values())
        total = sum(f for f in freq.values() if f == max_freq)
        return total
```
