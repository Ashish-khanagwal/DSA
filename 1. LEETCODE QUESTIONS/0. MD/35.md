# Two Sum II – Input Array Is Sorted

# Intuition

We are given a **sorted array** and need to find two numbers whose sum equals the target.  
The sorted property is key here: if the sum of two numbers is too small, we can move the left pointer right to increase it; if it’s too large, we move the right pointer left to decrease it.

---

# Approach

1. Initialize two pointers:
   - `l` at the start of the array.
   - `r` at the end of the array.
2. Calculate the sum of `numbers[l] + numbers[r]`.
   - If the sum equals the target, return the indices `[l+1, r+1]` (1-indexed).
   - If the sum is less than the target, move the left pointer (`l += 1`) to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than the target, move the right pointer (`r -= 1`) to decrease the sum.
3. Continue until the pair is found.
4. Return an empty list if no solution exists (though the problem guarantees exactly one solution).

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — each element is visited at most once.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$ — only two pointers are used.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        if len(numbers) <= 1:
            return numbers

        l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1

        while l < r:
            window_sum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
            if window_sum == target:
                return [l+1, r+1]
            elif window_sum < target:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        return []
```
