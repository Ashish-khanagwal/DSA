# Intuition

The problem asks us to add an integer `k` to an integer represented as an array `num`.  
Since each digit is stored separately, we must simulate the **manual addition process** (like how we add numbers by hand from right to left).

---

# Approach

1. Start from the last digit of `num` (the least significant digit).
2. Add it to `k` â€” this automatically handles any carryover since we update `k` after each addition.
3. Append the last digit of the sum (`k % 10`) to the result list.
4. Divide `k` by 10 (`k //= 10`) to move to the next digit (carry).
5. Continue until both `num` and `k` are fully processed.
6. Reverse the result list at the end since we built it from least to most significant digit.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ â€” We iterate through all digits once.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(n)$$ â€” We use an extra list to store the result.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def addToArrayForm(self, num: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        i = len(num) - 1

        while i >= 0 or k > 0:
            if i >= 0:
                k += num[i]
            res.append(k % 10)
            k //= 10
            i -= 1

        return res[::-1]

```
