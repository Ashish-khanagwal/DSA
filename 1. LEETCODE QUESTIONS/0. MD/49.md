# Problem -> Find Max Consecutive Ones

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode - Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)

---

## Intuition

We want to find the longest streak of `1`s in the binary array.  
The idea is straightforward: we scan through the array while keeping track of the current streak length and the maximum streak seen so far.

---

## Approach

1. Initialize two variables:
   - `count` → to store the current consecutive count of `1`s.
   - `maxx` → to store the maximum streak of consecutive `1`s encountered.

2. Traverse through each element in the array:
   - If the element is `1`, increment `count`.
   - If the element is `0`, reset `count` to `0`.

3. At each step, update `maxx` with the maximum of `maxx` and `count`.

4. After traversal, return `maxx`.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$  
  We iterate through the array once.

- **Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$  
  Only a few variables are used, no extra data structures.

## Code

```python3
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        maxx = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i == 1:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            maxx = max(maxx, count)
        return maxx

```
