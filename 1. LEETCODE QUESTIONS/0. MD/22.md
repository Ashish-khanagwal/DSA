# Find N Unique Integers Sum up to Zero

## Intuition

We need to generate `n` unique integers such that their sum is exactly `0`.  
A simple trick is to take numbers in **positive-negative pairs** (e.g., `1` and `-1`), since each pair cancels out to zero.  
If `n` is odd, we can just add an extra `0` to keep the sum balanced.

## Approach

1. Initialize an empty list `arr`.
2. Loop from `1` to `n // 2`:
   - Append both `i` and `-i` to the list.
   - Each pair contributes `0` to the total sum.
3. If `n` is odd, append a single `0` at the end.
4. Return the list.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity:** O(n) â€” we iterate through about `n/2` numbers.
- **Space complexity:** O(n) â€” we store `n` integers in the result list.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def sumZero(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        arr = []
        for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
            arr.append(i)
            arr.append(-i)
        if n % 2 == 1:
            arr.append(0)
        return arr

```
