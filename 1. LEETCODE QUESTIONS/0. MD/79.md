# Intuition

The problem gives us a list of operations that modify a single variable `X`, which starts at 0.  
Each operation either **increments** or **decrements** `X` by 1, depending on whether it contains `'++'` or `'--'`.  
So, the main task is simply to **count how many increments and decrements occur** and update `X` accordingly.

---

# Approach

1. Initialize `X = 0`.
2. Loop through each operation in the list:
   - If the operation contains `'++'`, increment `X` by 1.
   - If it contains `'--'`, decrement `X` by 1.
3. After processing all operations, return the final value of `X`.

This works because the position of `++` or `--` (whether before or after `X`) doesnâ€™t change the effect on the variable.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$  
  We iterate through all operations once.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$  
  Only one integer variable `X` is used.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def finalValueAfterOperations(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        X = 0

        for x in operations:
            if '++' in x:
                X += 1
            else:
                X -= 1

        return X

```
