# Intuition

We need to check whether string `s` appears as a subsequence in string `t`.  
A subsequence means the characters of `s` should appear in the **same order** in `t`, but not necessarily consecutively.  
So, we can simply scan through `t` and try to match characters of `s` one by one.

# Approach

1. If `s` is empty, return `True` (empty string is always a subsequence).
2. If `len(s) > len(t)`, return `False` (impossible case).
3. Use two pointers:
   - `i` for string `s`
   - `j` for string `t` (loop through `t`)
4. Whenever `s[i] == t[j]`, move pointer `i` forward.
5. At the end, if `i == len(s)`, it means we matched all characters of `s` inside `t`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n), where `n = len(t)` â†’ we scan through `t` once.

- Space complexity: O(1), since we only use a few variables.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if not s:
            return True
        if len(s) > len(t):
            return False
        i = 0
        for j in t:
            if i < len(s) and s[i] == j:
                i+=1
        return i == len(s)
```
