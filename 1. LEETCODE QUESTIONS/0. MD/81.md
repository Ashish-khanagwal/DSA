# Intuition

When typing a string on a keyboard, a **key change** happens whenever you move from one letter to another that is **different (case-insensitive)**.  
So the task is to count how many times consecutive characters differ, ignoring case.

---

# Approach

1. Convert characters to lowercase while comparing, so that `'A'` and `'a'` are treated the same.
2. Keep track of the **last used character** (in lowercase).
3. For every next character in the string:
   - If it’s different from the last used one → increment the change counter.
   - Update the last used character.
4. Return the total number of key changes.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — We iterate through the string once.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$ — Only a few variables are used.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def countKeyChanges(self, s: str) -> int:
        changes = 0
        last_used = s[0].lower()

        for c in s[1:]:
            if c.lower() != last_used:
                changes += 1
            last_used = c.lower()

        return changes

```
