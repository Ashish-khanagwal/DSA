# Intuition

The problem asks for the **maximum absolute difference** between adjacent elements in a **circular array**.  
In a circular array, the **first and last elements are also considered adjacent**.

So, to find the result, we just need to check the difference between:

1. Every pair of adjacent elements in the array.
2. The last element and the first element (because of the circular nature).

---

# Approach

1. Initialize a variable `max_diff` to store the maximum difference found.
2. Iterate through the array `nums`:
   - For every index `i`, calculate the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and the **next element**.
   - For the **last element**, calculate the difference between `nums[-1]` and `nums[0]` (circular adjacency).
3. Update `max_diff` with the maximum of the current and previously found differences.
4. Return `max_diff`.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — we traverse the array once.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$ — we use only a few extra variables.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def maxAdjacentDistance(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_diff = 0

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i < len(nums) - 1:
                diff = abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1])
            else:
                diff = abs(nums[0] - nums[-1])
            max_diff = max(max_diff, diff)

        return max_diff
```
