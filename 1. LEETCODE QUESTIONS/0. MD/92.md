# Intuition

The problem asks to find the largest number in the array whose **value is equal to its frequency**.  
The intuition is simple — count how many times each number appears, then check if any number has a count equal to its own value.

---

# Approach

1. Create a frequency dictionary (`freq`) to store how many times each number appears in `arr`.
2. Iterate over the dictionary:
   - For each number `k` with frequency `v`, check if `k == v`.
   - If true, it’s a “lucky” number.
   - Keep track of the largest lucky number found.
3. If no lucky number exists, return `-1`.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — for counting and iterating through elements once.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — for storing element frequencies.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def findLucky(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        freq = {}
        for a in arr:
            freq[a] = freq.get(a, 0) + 1

        max_l = -1
        for k, v in freq.items():
            if k == v:
                max_l = max(max_l, k)

        return max_l
```
