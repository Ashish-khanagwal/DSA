# Intuition

The problem requires finding the maximum difference between two elements such that the larger element comes after the smaller one.  
The key insight is to continuously track the smallest element seen so far while iterating through the array, and at each step, compute the difference with the current element to find the maximum possible value.

---

# Approach

1. Initialize `min_val` as the first element to represent the smallest element seen so far.
2. Initialize `max_diff` as `-1` to handle the case where no valid increasing pair exists.
3. Iterate through the array from the second element onward:
   - If the current element is greater than `min_val`, calculate the difference and update `max_diff` if it’s larger.
   - Otherwise, update `min_val` to the current element.
4. Return `max_diff` after completing the traversal.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — only one pass through the array.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$ — uses constant extra space.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def maximumDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        min_val = nums[0]
        max_diff = -1

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > min_val:
                max_diff = max(max_diff, nums[i] - min_val)
            else:
                min_val = nums[i]

        return max_diff
```
