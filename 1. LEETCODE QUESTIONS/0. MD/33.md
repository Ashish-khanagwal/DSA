# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

# Intuition

We need to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.  
A natural thought is to **keep track of characters in the current substring** and dynamically update the longest length as we move through the string.

---

# Approach

1. Use a **sliding window** with two pointers (`left` and `right`).
2. Use a `set` to store characters currently in the window.
3. Iterate through the string with the `right` pointer:
   - If `s[right]` is already in the set, move the `left` pointer forward and remove characters from the set until `s[right]` can be added.
   - Add `s[right]` to the set.
   - Update the `max_length` with the current window size (`right - left + 1`).
4. Return the `max_length` after iterating through the string.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — each character is added and removed at most once.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(min(n, a))$$ — where `a` is the size of the character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters), for storing characters in the set.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        substring = set()
        left = 0
        max_length = 0

        for right in range(len(s)):
            while s[right] in substring:
                substring.remove(s[left])
                left += 1
            substring.add(s[right])
            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

        return max_length

```
