# Intuition

We are asked to find the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length `k`.  
A naive approach would check all possible subarrays of size `k`, but that would be too slow ($$O(nk)$$).  
Instead, we can use a **sliding window**: once we compute the sum of the first `k` elements, we can slide the window one step at a time by subtracting the element that goes out and adding the element that comes in.

---

# Approach

1. Compute the initial sum of the first `k` elements.
2. Initialize `max_sum` with this initial sum.
3. Iterate through the array from index `k` to `n-1`:
   - Update the current window sum by removing the element `nums[i-k]` (leaving the window) and adding `nums[i]` (entering the window).
   - Update `max_sum` if the new sum is larger.
4. After processing all windows, return `max_sum / k` as the maximum average.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$
  - Each element is added and subtracted once.

- **Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$
  - We only keep track of a few variables (`window_sum`, `max_sum`).

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        window_sum = sum(nums[:k])
        max_sum = window_sum

        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            window_sum += nums[i] - nums[i-k]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
        return max_sum / k

```
