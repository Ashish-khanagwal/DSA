# Intuition

Roman numerals are generally written from largest to smallest left to right, but there’s one exception:

- If a smaller numeral comes before a larger numeral, it means subtraction (e.g., IV = 4, IX = 9).

So, while traversing the string:

- Normally, just add the value of the current symbol.
- But if the current symbol is less than the next symbol, it’s a subtraction case → add (next - current) and skip both.

# Approach

1. Create a dictionary `roman` that maps each Roman symbol to its integer value.

```
I=1, V=5, X=10, L=50, C=100, D=500, M=1000
```

2. Initialize `total = 0` and a pointer `i = 0`.
3. While iterating through the string:
   - If `s[i] < s[i+1]`, this is a subtraction case → add `(s[i+1] - s[i])` to total and move i by 2.
   - Otherwise, just add `s[i]` to `total` and move `i` by 1.

Return `total`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n) → we scan through the string once.

- Space complexity: O(1) → only a dictionary with fixed 7 Roman mappings.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman = {
            "I": 1, "V": 5, "X": 10, "L": 50, "C": 100, "D": 500, "M": 1000
        }
        i = 0
        total = 0
        while i < len(s):
            if i < len(s) - 1 and roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i+1]]:
                total += roman[s[i+1]] - roman[s[i]]
                i += 2
            else:
                total += roman[s[i]]
                i += 1
        return total
```
