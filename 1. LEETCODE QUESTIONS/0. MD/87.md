# Intuition

The problem asks for the **maximum difference** between the most frequent character that appears an **odd** number of times and the least frequent character that appears an **even** number of times.

To solve this, the key is to:

- Count how many times each character appears.
- Separate the counts into **odd** and **even** frequency groups.
- Then find the difference between the **maximum odd frequency** and **minimum even frequency**.

---

# Approach

1. **Count character frequencies:**  
   Use `collections.Counter` to count how many times each character appears in the string `s`.

2. **Separate even and odd frequencies:**
   - Iterate through the frequency values.
   - Add even frequencies to the `even` list and odd frequencies to the `odd` list.

3. **Find the min and max:**
   - `min_even` = the smallest even frequency.
   - `max_odd` = the largest odd frequency.

4. **Compute difference:**  
   Return `max_odd - min_even`.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — counting frequencies takes linear time relative to the string length.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(k)$$ — where `k` is the number of unique characters (at most 26 for lowercase letters).

# Code

```python3 []
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def maxDifference(self, s: str) -> int:
        counter = Counter(s)

        even = [freq for freq in counter.values() if freq % 2 == 0]
        odd = [freq for freq in counter.values() if freq % 2 == 1]

        min_even = min(even)
        max_odd = max(odd)

        return max_odd - min_even
```
