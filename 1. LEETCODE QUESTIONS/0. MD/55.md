# Intuition

The task is to determine how many times we can form the word **"balloon"** using characters from the given string.  
Since each character can only be used once, the maximum number of "balloon"s is limited by the **minimum availability** of required characters.

---

# Approach

1. Count the frequency of each character in the given string using a hashmap.
2. Define the frequency requirements for the word `"balloon"`:
   - `b:1, a:1, l:2, o:2, n:1`
3. For each required character, check how many times it can be used by dividing the available count by its requirement.
4. The result is the minimum among all these values, since the scarcest character limits the number of complete words that can be formed.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$
  - We traverse the input string once to build the frequency map.

- **Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$
  - Hashmap stores at most 26 characters (constant space).

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfBalloons(self, text: str) -> int:
        hashmap = {}

        # Count frequency of each character
        for ch in text:
            hashmap[ch] = hashmap.get(ch, 0) + 1

        # Required frequency for the word "balloon"
        required = {'b':1, 'a': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 2, 'n': 1}

        # Minimum ratio of available to required
        return min(hashmap.get(ch, 0) // required[ch] for ch in required)

```
