# Intuition

When reversing vowels in a string, only the positions of vowels need to be swapped while all other characters remain unchanged.  
A simple way is to use the **two-pointer technique**, where one pointer moves from the left and the other from the right, swapping vowels when found.

# Approach

1. Convert the string into a list (since strings are immutable in Python).
2. Initialize two pointers:
   - `l` starting from the beginning.
   - `r` starting from the end.
3. Move `l` forward until it finds a vowel.
4. Move `r` backward until it finds a vowel.
5. When both `l` and `r` point to vowels, swap them.
6. Continue until the two pointers cross.
7. Finally, join the list back into a string and return it.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — each character is checked at most once.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — due to converting the string into a list (and result string construction).

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def reverseVowels(self, s: str) -> str:
        l = 0
        r = len(s) - 1

        vowel = set('aeiouAEIOU')
        temp = list(s)

        while l < r:
            if temp[l] not in vowel:
                l += 1
            elif temp[r] not in vowel:
                r -= 1
            else:
                temp[l], temp[r] = temp[r], temp[l]
                l += 1
                r -= 1

        s = "".join(ch for ch in temp)
        return s
```
