# Intuition

We need to reverse the string, but since the input is given as an array of characters, we should not create a new array/List. Instead, we can reverse it in-place by swapping characters from both ends toward the middle.

# Approach

1. Use two pointers:
   - l starts at the beginning of the array.
   - r starts at the end of the array.

2. While l < r:
   - Swap s[l] and s[r].
   - Move l forward (l += 1) and r backward (r -= 1).

3. Continue until both pointers meet or cross.
   This ensures that every element is swapped with its mirror position, reversing the array in-place.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:
  O(n) → We visit each element at most once (each swap processes two characters)

- Space complexity:
  O(1) → We only use two variables (l and r), no extra array.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1

        while l < r:
            s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]

            l += 1
            r -= 1
        print(s)

```
