# Intuition

The problem is based on a simple arithmetic pattern — each week, the amount deposited starts one unit higher than the previous week, and each subsequent day of the week increases by 1.  
So, the money added forms an **arithmetic progression (AP)** both weekly and daily.  
We can compute the total sum using the AP sum formula instead of simulating day-by-day deposits.

# Approach

1. **Divide the days into full weeks and leftover days:**
   - Each week has 7 days, so:
     - `weeks = n // 7`
     - `days = n % 7`
2. **Compute the total money for complete weeks:**
   - The first week’s total = 28 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7)
   - Each next week starts one unit higher → weekly totals form another AP:
     - Week 1 → 28
     - Week 2 → 35
     - Week 3 → 42, and so on.
   - Use AP sum formula:  
     `total_weeks = (weeks * (2 * 28 + (weeks - 1) * 7)) // 2`
3. **Compute the money for leftover days (if any):**
   - The starting day of the new (incomplete) week = `weeks + 1`
   - Use AP formula for remaining days:
     `total_days = (days * (2 * start + (days - 1))) // 2`
4. Add both totals and return the final result.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(1)$$ — Only arithmetic operations are used.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$ — No extra data structures are needed.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def totalMoney(self, n: int) -> int:
        weeks = n // 7
        days = n % 7

        total = (weeks * (2 * 28 + (weeks - 1) * 7)) // 2

        start = weeks + 1
        total += (days * (2 * start + (days - 1))) // 2

        return total

```
