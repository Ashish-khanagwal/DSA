# Problem -> Single Number

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode - Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

## Intuition

Every number in the array appears exactly twice except for one unique number.  
The key insight is to leverage the **XOR property**:

- `a ^ a = 0`
- `a ^ 0 = a`
- XOR is commutative and associative.

This means that if we XOR all numbers together, the pairs cancel out, leaving only the unique number.

## Approach

1. Initialize a variable `res = 0`.
2. Traverse the list and XOR each element with `res`.
3. Since duplicates cancel out, at the end, `res` will hold the single unique number.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$  
  We iterate over the array once.

- **Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$  
  No extra data structures are used.

## Code

```python3
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in nums:
            res ^= i
        return res

```
