# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Intuition

The goal is to maximize profit by choosing the best day to buy and the best day to sell later.  
To achieve this, we need to track the **lowest price so far** (best day to buy) and calculate the profit if we sold on the current day. The maximum profit across all days will be our answer.

## Approach 1: Greedy (Track Minimum Price)

1. Initialize `min_price` as the first price.
2. Initialize `max_profit` as `0`.
3. Iterate over the prices:
   - If the current price is smaller than `min_price`, update `min_price`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the profit (`current price - min_price`) and update `max_profit` if this profit is greater.
4. Return `max_profit` at the end.

## Approach 2: Sliding Window

We can also think of this problem as a **sliding window** with two pointers:

- `left` → the day we buy (window start).
- `right` → the day we sell (window end).

### Steps:

1. Start with `left = 0` (buy day) and `right = 1` (sell day).
2. Move `right` forward through the list:
   - If `prices[right] >= prices[left]`, calculate profit and update `max_profit`.
   - If `prices[right] < prices[left]`, this means we’ve found a cheaper day to buy, so shift `left = right`.
3. Continue until `right` reaches the end of the list.

This approach is essentially doing the same as the greedy one but makes the "buy day" and "sell day" relationship more explicit.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity:** O(n) — we scan the list once in both approaches.
- **Space complexity:** O(1) — only a few variables are used.

## Code: Greedy

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = prices[0]
        max_profit = 0

        for i in range(len(prices)):
            if prices[i] < min_price:
                min_price = prices[i]

            max_profit = max(max_profit, prices[i] - min_price)

        return max_profit
```

## Code: Sliding Window

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0   # buy day
        right = 1  # sell day
        max_profit = 0

        while right < len(prices):
            if prices[right] > prices[left]:
                profit = prices[right] - prices[left]
                max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
            else:
                left = right
            right += 1

        return max_profit
```
