# Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers

## Intuition

We want to split a given integer `n` into two positive integers `a` and `b` such that:

- `a + b = n`
- Neither `a` nor `b` contains the digit `0`.

There are two main approaches:

1. **Brute force (single loop over all possible values of `a`)**
2. **Two-pointer style approach (moving inward from both ends)**

Both guarantee a valid solution.

## Approach 1: Brute Force

1. Iterate `a` from `1` to `n - 1`.
2. Set `b = n - a`.
3. Check if `"0"` is present in either `a` or `b`.
4. If not, return `[a, b]`.

### Complexity

- **Time complexity:** O(n) in the worst case.
- **Space complexity:** O(1).

```python
class Solution:
    def getNoZeroIntegers(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        for a in range(1, n):
            b = n - a
            if "0" not in str(a) and "0" not in str(b):
                return [a, b]
```

## Approach 2: Two-Pointer Style

Instead of scanning all values of `a`, we start with two pointers:

- `left = 1`
- `right = n - 1`

Then:

1. If either `left` or `right` contains `"0"`, move both pointers inward (`left += 1`, `right -= 1`).
2. If their sum equals `n` and no zeros exist, return `[left, right]`.
3. Continue until a valid pair is found.

### Complexity

- **Time complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, but often faster in practice since both `left` and `right` move each iteration.
- **Space complexity:** O(1).

```python
def getNoZeroIntegers(n: int) -> list[int]:
    left = 1
    right = n - 1
    result = []
    while left < n:
        if "0" in str(left) or "0" in str(right):
            right -= 1
            left += 1
        elif left + right == n:
            result.append(left)
            result.append(right)
            return result
        else:
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```

## Difference Between the Two Approaches

- **Brute Force:**
  - Simpler and more direct.
  - Always increments `a` and calculates `b`.
  - May check more pairs unnecessarily.

- **Two-Pointer Style:**
  - Works symmetrically by adjusting both ends.
  - Reduces redundant checks since `left` and `right` move together.
  - Can be slightly faster in practice, but worst-case complexity remains O(n).

âœ… Both approaches are valid, with similar complexity. For simplicity, **Approach 1 (brute force)** is often preferred in interviews, while **Approach 2** demonstrates creative problem-solving with two pointers.
