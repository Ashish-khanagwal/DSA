# Problem -> Missing in Array

## Intuition

If you have numbers from `1` to `n` and one is missing, XOR can be used to identify the missing number:

- XORing a number with itself cancels out (`a ^ a = 0`).
- XOR is commutative and associative, so the missing number will remain after canceling all present numbers with their indices.

---

## Approach

1. Initialize `res = 0`.
2. Iterate over the array indices:
   - XOR `res` with `i` and `arr[i]`.
3. Finally, XOR `res` with `len(arr)` to account for the missing last number `n`.
4. Return `res`, which will be the missing number.

This works because XOR of all numbers from `0` to `n` combined with XOR of all array elements cancels out all numbers except the missing one.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$
  - Single pass over the array.

- **Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$
  - Only a single variable `res` is used.

## Code

```python3
def missingNum(arr):
    res = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        res ^= i ^ arr[i]
    return res ^ len(arr)

print(missingNum([1, 2, 3, 5]))                    # Output: 4
print(missingNum([8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]))          # Output: 6
print(missingNum([1]))                             # Output: 2

```
