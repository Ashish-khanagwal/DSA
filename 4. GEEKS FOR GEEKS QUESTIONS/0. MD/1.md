# Problem -> Second Largest Element in Array

## Intuition

To find the **second largest element** in an array, we need to keep track of two values as we traverse:

- The largest element seen so far.
- The second largest element seen so far.

By maintaining these two variables in one pass, we can solve the problem efficiently.

## Approach

1. Initialize `largest` and `second_largest` as `-∞`.
2. Iterate over each number in the array:
   - If the current number is greater than `largest`:
     - Update `second_largest = largest`.
     - Update `largest = current number`.
   - Else if the current number is greater than `second_largest` **and not equal to `largest`**, update `second_largest`.
3. After the loop, check:
   - If `second_largest` is still `-∞`, return `-1` (meaning no valid second largest element exists).
   - Otherwise, return `second_largest`.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$  
  We traverse the array once.

- **Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$  
  Only two extra variables are used.

## Code

```python3
def getSecondLargest(nums):
    largest = second_largest = float('-inf')
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > largest:
            second_largest = largest
            largest = nums[i]
        elif nums[i] > second_largest and nums[i] != largest:
            second_largest = nums[i]

    return second_largest if second_largest != float('-inf') else -1


# Example Runs
print(getSecondLargest([12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]))  # Output: 34
print(getSecondLargest([10, 5, 10]))             # Output: 5
print(getSecondLargest([10, 10, 10]))            # Output: -1

```
