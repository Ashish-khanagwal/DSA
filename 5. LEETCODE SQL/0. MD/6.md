# Intuition

The goal is to find the highest-paid employee(s) in each department.  
Each department can have one or more employees with the same maximum salary,  
so we need to compare every employee’s salary with the **maximum salary** of their department.

# Approach

We join the `Employee` and `Department` tables using their common field `departmentId`.  
For each employee, we use a **subquery** to find the maximum salary within the same department  
(`WHERE departmentId = d.id`).  
If an employee’s salary matches this maximum, that employee is selected in the result.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** `O(n)` — Each employee is checked against the subquery once per department.
- **Space complexity:** `O(1)` — We are not using any additional space except for query execution.

# Code

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d
ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE e.salary = (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM Employee
    WHERE departmentId = d.id
);

```
