# Intuition

The task is to calculate a special bonus for each employee based on specific conditions.  
Employees with an even `employee_id` should receive no bonus, and employees whose names start with the letter **'M'** should also receive no bonus.  
Only employees with an odd `employee_id` **and** a name that does not start with `'M'` are eligible to receive a bonus equal to their salary.

# Approach

1. Select each employee along with their `employee_id`.
2. Use a `CASE` expression to compute the bonus:
   - If `employee_id` is even, return `0`.
   - If `employee_id` is odd and the employee’s name does not start with `'M'`, return the employee’s `salary`.
   - Otherwise, return `0`.
3. Alias the computed value as `bonus`.
4. Order the results by `employee_id` as required.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The table is scanned once and each row is evaluated → **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  No extra data structures are used beyond the output → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    employee_id,
    CASE
        WHEN employee_id % 2 = 0 THEN 0
        WHEN employee_id % 2 = 1 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%' THEN salary
        ELSE 0
    END AS bonus
FROM Employees
ORDER BY employee_id;
```
