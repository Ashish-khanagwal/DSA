# Intuition

We need to find all the days where the temperature was higher than the previous day.  
For each record, we compare its temperature with the previous day’s temperature.

# Approach

We can solve this problem using a self-join:

- Join the `Weather` table with itself — one as the current day (`w1`) and the other as the previous day (`w2`).
- Use `DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1` to match each day with its previous day.
- Filter out the records where today’s temperature is greater than yesterday’s.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

# Code

```mysql
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
ON DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
```
