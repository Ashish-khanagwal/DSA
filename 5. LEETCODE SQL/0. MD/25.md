# Intuition

To determine whether three line segments can form a triangle, we use the Triangle Inequality Theorem.  
The theorem states that the sum of any two sides must be **strictly greater** than the third side.  
If all three conditions hold true, the segments form a valid triangle.

# Approach

For each row in the `Triangle` table, we evaluate the three necessary conditions:

- `x + y > z`
- `x + z > y`
- `y + z > x`

We use a `CASE` expression to return **'Yes'** if all conditions are met and **'No'** otherwise.  
Then we output all rows along with the triangle status.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  $$O(n)$$  
  Each row requires evaluating three constant-time comparisons.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  $$O(1)$$  
  No additional data structures are used.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT x, y, z,
CASE
    WHEN x + y > z
         AND x + z > y
         AND y + z > x
    THEN 'Yes'
    ELSE 'No'
END AS triangle
FROM Triangle;
```
