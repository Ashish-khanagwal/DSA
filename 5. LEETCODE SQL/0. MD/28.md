# Intuition

We need to swap every pair of consecutive students.  
That means:

- Student at seat **1 swaps with 2**
- **3 swaps with 4**
- **5 swaps with 6**, and so on.

If the total number of students is **odd**, the last student remains unchanged.

# Approach

We can compute the _new id_ by applying:

- If `id` is **odd** and not the last id → new id = `id + 1`
- If `id` is **even** → new id = `id - 1`
- Otherwise (last odd id) → keep as is

This can be done using MySQL's `IF()` function for concise logic.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The query performs a full table scan + a constant-time MAX lookup → **O(n)**

- **Space Complexity:**  
  No extra structures are created → **O(1)**

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    IF(id % 2 = 1 AND id <> (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat), id + 1,
       IF(id % 2 = 0, id - 1, id)) AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;
```
