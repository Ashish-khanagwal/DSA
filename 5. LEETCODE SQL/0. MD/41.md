# Intuition

To determine how far each user has traveled, we need to combine user information with ride data.  
Since some users may not have taken any rides, their travelled distance should be treated as **0** instead of `NULL`.

# Approach

- Perform a `LEFT JOIN` between `Users` and `Rides` to ensure all users appear in the result.
- Use `SUM(r.distance)` to calculate total distance for each user.
- Wrap the `SUM` in `IFNULL()` to convert `NULL` to **0**.
- Group results by each user.
- Order primarily by travelled distance (descending) and secondarily by name (ascending).

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  Joining and grouping depends on number of users (U) and rides (R), giving  
  **O(U + R)**.
- **Space complexity:**  
  Only aggregated results are stored, so **O(U)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    u.name,
    IFNULL(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS travelled_distance
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r
    ON u.id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.id
ORDER BY travelled_distance DESC, u.name ASC;
```
