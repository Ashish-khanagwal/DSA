# Intuition

The problem asks us to find products that were sold **only** during the first quarter of 2019  
(2019-01-01 to 2019-03-31).  
This means a valid product must satisfy two conditions:

1. It must have **at least one sale** in Q1 2019.
2. It must **not have any sale** before Q1 or after Q1.

The idea is to filter products that appear in Q1 sales and then eliminate those that appear
outside this date range.

# Approach

1. Use a `LEFT JOIN` to connect products with their sales.
2. Filter the joined rows to return only sales occurring in Q1 2019.
3. Use a subquery with `NOT IN` to exclude products that were sold outside Q1.
4. Select product_id and product_name while removing duplicates with `DISTINCT`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Full scan of the Sales table + subquery filtering → **O(n)**
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Only minimal extra space used for JOIN and filtering → **O(1)**

# Code

```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name
FROM Product p
LEFT JOIN Sales s
    ON p.product_id = s.product_id
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31'
  AND p.product_id NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT product_id
        FROM Sales
        WHERE sale_date > '2019-03-31'
           OR sale_date < '2019-01-01'
    );
```
