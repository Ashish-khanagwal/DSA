# 🧠 Problem Explanation

We have two tables:

- **Employee(empId, name, department, …)**
- **Bonus(empId, bonus)**

We need to return the **names of employees** and their **bonus amounts** where:

- the bonus is **less than 1000**, or
- the employee has **no bonus record** (i.e., `NULL`).

---

## 💡 Intuition

Not all employees might have received a bonus.  
So, a **LEFT JOIN** ensures that even employees **without bonus records** appear in the result.  
Then, we simply filter for bonuses that are **less than 1000** or **missing (`NULL`)**.

---

## 🧩 Approach

1. Select data from both tables: `Employee` and `Bonus`.
2. Join them using **LEFT JOIN** on the common column `empId`.
3. Apply a filter:
   - Include rows where `bonus < 1000`.
   - Include rows where `bonus IS NULL`.
4. Return the employee name and bonus amount.

---

## ⚙️ Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - Depends on the number of records in `Employee` and `Bonus` tables (assuming indexed `empId`).

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  - Only uses memory to hold the result set, no extra data structures.

## 🧾 Code

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    e.name,
    b.bonus
FROM Employee AS e
LEFT JOIN Bonus AS b
ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL;

```
