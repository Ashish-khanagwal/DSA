# Intuition

We need to find employees who earn less than $30,000 and whose managers are no longer present in the company.  
A manager leaving the company means that the manager’s `employee_id` no longer exists in the Employees table, even though the employee’s `manager_id` still references it.

# Approach

1. Use a **self LEFT JOIN** on the Employees table to attempt to match each employee’s `manager_id` with a valid employee record.
2. If the join fails (`e1.employee_id IS NULL`), it indicates that the manager does not exist in the table anymore.
3. Filter employees whose salary is strictly less than 30,000.
4. Exclude employees who never had a manager (`manager_id IS NOT NULL`).
5. Return the remaining employee IDs and order them in ascending order.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The self join scans the table once, resulting in **O(n)** time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  No additional data structures are required beyond the output → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT e.employee_id
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Employees e1
    ON e.manager_id = e1.employee_id
WHERE e.salary < 30000
  AND e.manager_id IS NOT NULL
  AND e1.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
```
