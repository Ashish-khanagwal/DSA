# Intuition

The problem asks us to find the names of customers who were **not referred by a specific person (with `referee_id = 2`)**.  
This means we simply need to filter out all customers whose `referee_id` equals `2`, while keeping those with a different `referee_id` or no referee at all (`NULL`).

# Approach

1. Select the `name` column from the `Customer` table.
2. Use a `WHERE` clause to filter customers:
   - Include customers whose `referee_id` is **not equal to 2** (`referee_id != 2`).
   - Also include customers whose `referee_id` is **NULL** (i.e., they were not referred by anyone).
3. This combination ensures we exclude only those directly referred by the referee with ID 2.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  $$O(n)$$ — We scan through each record in the `Customer` table once.
- **Space complexity:**  
  $$O(1)$$ — No additional data structures are used beyond the query.

# Code

```mysql []
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```
