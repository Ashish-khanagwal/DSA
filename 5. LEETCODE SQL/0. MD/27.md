# Intuition

The problem asks us to filter movies based on two conditions:

1. The movie `id` should be odd.
2. The movie `description` should not be `"boring"`.

Once filtered, we need to sort the remaining movies by their `rating` in descending order.

# Approach

- Use `WHERE id % 2 != 0` to keep only odd-numbered rows.
- Use `AND description <> 'boring'` to exclude boring movies.
- Apply `ORDER BY rating DESC` to sort by highest rating first.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  The query scans the table once and applies filtering + sorting → **O(n log n)** due to sorting.

- **Space complexity:**  
   Sorting and filtering require minimal extra memory → **O(1)** or **O(log n)** depending on engine implementation.

# Code

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT *
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 != 0
AND description <> 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```
