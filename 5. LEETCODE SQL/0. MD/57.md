# Intuition

We want to find how many followers each user has.  
Since the `Followers` table can contain multiple rows per user (one for each follower), we need to count how many times each `user_id` appears.  
Using a window function allows us to compute this count while still returning one row per user.

# Approach

1. Read all rows from the `Followers` table.
2. Use the window function `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id)` to count the number of followers for each user.
3. Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that each `user_id` appears only once in the final result.
4. Order the output by `user_id` for consistency.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Scanning the table and computing window counts takes **O(n)** time.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  The window function uses constant extra space beyond the output → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) AS followers_count
FROM Followers
ORDER BY user_id;
```
