# Intuition

We need to find the most recent login for each user, but only considering logins that occurred in the year 2020.  
Any login outside of 2020 should be ignored, and users who never logged in during 2020 should not appear in the result.

# Approach

1. Filter the `Logins` table to include only timestamps from the year 2020.
2. Group the filtered records by `user_id` so each user appears once.
3. Use the aggregate function `MAX(time_stamp)` to find the latest login timestamp for each user within 2020.
4. Return the user ID along with their latest login time.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Scanning and grouping the logins table takes **O(n)** time.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Only aggregation storage is used, resulting in **O(1)** extra space (excluding the output).

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    user_id,
    MAX(time_stamp) AS last_stamp
FROM Logins
WHERE time_stamp >= '2020-01-01'
  AND time_stamp < '2021-01-01'
GROUP BY user_id;
```
