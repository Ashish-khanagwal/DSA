# 🧠 Problem: Duplicate Emails

You are given a table `Person` that contains email addresses.  
Your task is to report all **duplicate emails** that appear more than once in the table.

---

## 💡 Intuition

The problem asks us to find emails that appear multiple times.  
Instead of comparing each row with every other row (which is inefficient),  
we can **group identical emails together** and simply count how many times each occurs.  
If an email appears **more than once**, it’s a duplicate.

---

## 🧩 Approach

1. Use the `GROUP BY` clause to group rows with the same `email`.
2. Use the `COUNT()` function to count how many times each email appears.
3. Filter groups where `COUNT(email) > 1` using the `HAVING` clause.
4. Select the `email` column and rename it as `Email` (to match the required output format).

## ⚙️ Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We scan the table once, grouping emails by value.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  - Only aggregated results are stored; no additional data structures are used.

## 🧾 Code

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    email AS Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(email) > 1;
```
