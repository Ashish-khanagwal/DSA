# Intuition

To find the Nth highest salary, we need to first sort the unique salaries in descending order. Then, we simply pick the Nth value from this sorted list. However, since SQL’s `OFFSET` is zero-based, we must adjust the user-provided `N` by subtracting 1.

# Approach

1. Sort all distinct salaries in descending order.
2. Use the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses to skip the first (N-1) salaries and return the next one.
3. Wrap this logic inside a SQL function `getNthHighestSalary(N)` so it can be called dynamically with any value of N.
4. Handle cases where fewer than N distinct salaries exist — the query automatically returns `NULL`.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** O(n log n) — due to sorting the salaries.
- **Space complexity:** O(n) — to store the sorted distinct salary list temporarily.

# Code

```mysql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
  SET N = N - 1;
  RETURN (
      SELECT DISTINCT salary
      FROM Employee
      ORDER BY salary DESC
      LIMIT 1 OFFSET N
  );
END
```
