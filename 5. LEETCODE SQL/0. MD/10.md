# Intuition

When ranking values such as scores, we often need to assign ranks based on order — for example, highest to lowest scores.  
However, when there are duplicate values (ties), the way ranks are assigned can differ depending on the function used — `RANK()` or `DENSE_RANK()`.

# Approach

1. Use **window functions** with `OVER (ORDER BY score DESC)` to rank rows dynamically without grouping or aggregating.
2. `DENSE_RANK()` assigns ranks **without skipping numbers** when there are ties.
3. Alternatively, `RANK()` assigns the same rank to ties but **skips the next rank number(s)**.

# Rules and Examples

### 🥇 Using `RANK()` — skips rank numbers after ties

```mysql
SELECT
  score,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score ASC) AS rank_increasing
FROM Scores;
```

#### Output:

| score | rank_increasing |
| ----- | --------------- |
| 3.50  | 1               |
| 3.65  | 2               |
| 3.65  | 2               |
| 3.85  | 4               |
| 4.00  | 5               |
| 4.00  | 5               |

> Notice: Rank jumps from 2 → 4 after duplicate 3.65.
> This is because `RANK()` skips rank numbers after ties.

### 🥈 Using DENSE_RANK() — does not skip rank numbers

```mysql
SELECT
  score,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score ASC) AS rank_increasing
FROM Scores;
```

#### Output:

| score | rank_increasing |
| ----- | --------------- |
| 3.50  | 1               |
| 3.65  | 2               |
| 3.65  | 2               |
| 3.85  | 3               |
| 4.00  | 4               |
| 4.00  | 4               |

> Here, `DENSE_RANK()` assigns the same rank for ties without skipping any numbers.

### Difference Summary

| Function         | Handles Duplicate Scores | Rank Gaps        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| **RANK()**       | ✅ Yes                   | ✅ Skips numbers |
| **DENSE_RANK()** | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ No skips      |

### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n log n) — due to sorting by score before ranking.

- Space complexity: O(1) — no additional tables or temporary structures used.

### CODE

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT score,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS `rank`
FROM Scores;
```
