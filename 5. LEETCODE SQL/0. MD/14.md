# Intuition

To determine each player's first login date, we need to identify the earliest date (`MIN(event_date)`) recorded for every player in the `Activity` table. Since each player can have multiple activity records, grouping by `player_id` helps us isolate their respective first login events.

# Approach

1. Use the `MIN()` aggregate function to find the earliest `event_date` for each player.
2. Group all records by `player_id` to ensure we process data per player.
3. The result will contain one row per player, showing their earliest login date as `first_login`.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** O(n) — we must scan all records once to find the minimum event date per player.
- **Space complexity:** O(n) — proportional to the number of distinct players stored temporarily for grouping.

# Code

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT e.player_id, MIN(e.event_date) AS first_login
FROM Activity e
GROUP BY e.player_id;
```
