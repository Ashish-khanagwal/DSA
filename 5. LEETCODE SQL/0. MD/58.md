# Intuition

We need to identify products that satisfy two specific conditions at the same time:  
they must be **low fat** and also **recyclable**.  
Both conditions are stored as flags in the `Products` table, so we simply need to filter rows where both flags are set to `'Y'`.

# Approach

1. Read all rows from the `Products` table.
2. Apply a `WHERE` clause to keep only those products where:
   - `low_fats = 'Y'`
   - `recyclable = 'Y'`
3. Select and return only the `product_id` column.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Scanning the `Products` table once → **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  No extra data structures are required → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y'
  AND recyclable = 'Y';
```
