# Intuition

The goal is to find customers who have **never placed any order**.  
When two tables are related by a foreign key (`Orders.customerId → Customers.id`), we can use a `LEFT JOIN` to include **all customers**, even those without a matching record in the `Orders` table.  
If a customer has **no matching order**, the joined fields from `Orders` will be `NULL`.

---

# Approach

1. Use a **LEFT JOIN** to combine the `Customers` table with the `Orders` table on the condition `Customers.id = Orders.customerId`.
2. This join ensures every customer appears at least once in the result — even those without orders.
3. Then, filter out customers who **have orders** by checking `WHERE Orders.customerId IS NULL`.
4. Finally, select only the `name` column and rename it as `Customers` for the final output.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \) — Each customer is joined with their matching order (if any). Efficient with indexed `id` and `customerId` columns.
- **Space complexity:**  
  \( O(1) \) — No extra data structures are used; only temporary join results.

# Code

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Customers.name AS Customers
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.id = Orders.customerId
WHERE Orders.customerId IS NULL;
```
