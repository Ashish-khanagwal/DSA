# Intuition

We need to identify products whose descriptions contain a valid serial number pattern.  
The serial number can appear anywhere inside the description, but it must strictly follow the required format.  
Using a regular expression allows us to validate the pattern precisely while scanning the description text.

# Approach

1. Select the required columns: `product_id`, `product_name`, and `description`.
2. Use `REGEXP_LIKE` to search for the serial number pattern inside the `description`.
3. Enforce **case-sensitive** matching by using the `'c'` match type so that only uppercase `SN` is accepted.
4. Construct the regex to ensure:
   - `SN` is not part of a larger alphanumeric word.
   - Exactly 4 digits follow `SN`.
   - A hyphen separates the digit groups.
   - Exactly 4 digits appear after the hyphen.
   - No extra digits are allowed after the serial number.
5. Order the result by `product_id` in ascending order.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Each product description is evaluated once using a regular expression → **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  No extra space is used apart from the output → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT product_id, product_name, description
FROM products
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(
    description,
    '(^|[^A-Za-z0-9])SN[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}([^0-9]|$)',
    'c'
)
ORDER BY product_id;
```
