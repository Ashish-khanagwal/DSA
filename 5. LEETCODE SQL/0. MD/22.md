# Intuition

Combine both `requester_id` and `accepter_id` into a single column so we can count the total occurrences of each user, regardless of whether they are requesting or accepting.

# Approach

1. Use `UNION ALL` to merge the two columns into a single column named `id`.
2. Group by `id` to count how many times each user appears.
3. Order the results by the count in descending order.
4. Limit the output to 1 to get the user with the highest total interactions.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  $$O(n)$$ — We scan each row of the table once and then perform grouping and counting.

- Space complexity:  
  $$O(n)$$ — For storing the combined table from both columns before aggregation.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
) AS combined
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
