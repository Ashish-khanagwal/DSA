# Intuition

We need to determine how many unique users were active on each day within a specific 30-day window.  
A user is considered active on a day if they performed **at least one** activity that day.  
Since the Activity table may contain duplicate rows or multiple activities per user per day, we must count users **distinctly**.

# Approach

1. Filter the Activity table to include only records within the 30-day period  
   (from **2019-06-28** to **2019-07-27**).
2. Group the filtered rows by `activity_date`, since we want results per day.
3. For each day, count the number of **distinct user_id** values to avoid double-counting users with multiple activities.
4. Return the day and its corresponding distinct active user count.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Filtering and grouping the table takes **O(n)**, where _n_ is the number of activity records.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Only uses grouping storage, resulting in **O(1)** auxiliary space (or O(k) for number of days returned).

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    a.activity_date AS day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT a.user_id) AS active_users
FROM Activity a
WHERE a.activity_date BETWEEN '2019-06-28' AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY a.activity_date;
```
