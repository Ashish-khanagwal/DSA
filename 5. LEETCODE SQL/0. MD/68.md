# Intuition

The original table stores revenue information in a **row-wise format**, where each row represents the revenue of a department for a specific month.  
The goal is to **reformat (pivot)** this data so that each department appears once, with a separate revenue column for each month.

# Approach

1. Group the data by `id` so that each row in the result corresponds to a single department.
2. Use **conditional aggregation** with `CASE WHEN` to extract the revenue for each month.
3. Wrap each `CASE` expression with an aggregate function (`MAX`) to collapse multiple rows into a single value per department.
4. Assign a separate column for each month’s revenue.
5. If a department has no revenue for a given month, the corresponding column will naturally return `NULL`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The table is scanned once and grouped by department → **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  No additional data structures are used beyond the result set → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jan' THEN revenue END) AS Jan_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Feb' THEN revenue END) AS Feb_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Mar' THEN revenue END) AS Mar_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Apr' THEN revenue END) AS Apr_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'May' THEN revenue END) AS May_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jun' THEN revenue END) AS Jun_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jul' THEN revenue END) AS Jul_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Aug' THEN revenue END) AS Aug_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Sep' THEN revenue END) AS Sep_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Oct' THEN revenue END) AS Oct_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Nov' THEN revenue END) AS Nov_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Dec' THEN revenue END) AS Dec_Revenue
FROM Department
GROUP BY id;
```
