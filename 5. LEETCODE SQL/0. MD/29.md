# Intuition

To swap values like `'m'` and `'f'` in a column, we need a way to transform each value into its opposite without losing data.  
Using a `CASE` expression ensures the swap happens safely in a single pass.

# Approach

- Use `CASE` to check the current value of the `sex` column.
- If the value is `'m'`, change it to `'f'`.
- If the value is `'f'`, change it to `'m'`.
- Otherwise, leave the value unchanged (important if other values exist).
- Apply the transformation in a single `UPDATE` to avoid temporary states.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  A full scan is required → **O(n)**
- **Space complexity:**  
  In-place update, no extra storage → **O(1)**

# Code

```mysql
UPDATE Salary
SET sex = CASE
    WHEN sex = 'm' THEN 'f'
    WHEN sex = 'f' THEN 'm'
    ELSE sex
END;
```
