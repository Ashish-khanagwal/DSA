# 🧠 Problem: Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

You are given an `Employee` table where each employee has an ID, name, salary, and an optional manager ID.  
The goal is to find employees who **earn more than their managers**.

---

## 💡 Intuition

Every employee’s `managerId` points to another employee’s `id` in the same table.  
So, by comparing an employee’s salary with their manager’s salary,  
we can find those who earn **more than their manager**.

This requires comparing data **within the same table**,  
so a **self join** is the perfect approach.

---

## 🧩 Approach

1. Use **self join** to treat the same table as two logical tables:
   - One alias (`a`) for **employee** data.
   - Another alias (`b`) for **manager** data.
2. Join them using the condition `a.managerId = b.id`.
3. Filter the results where the employee’s salary is greater than their manager’s (`a.salary > b.salary`).
4. Finally, select the employee’s name.

## ⚙️ Complexity

- **Time complexity:** `O(n)`  
  The join compares employee-manager pairs based on indexed IDs.

- **Space complexity:** `O(1)`  
  Only selected columns are returned; no extra data structures are used.

## 🧾 Code

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT a.name AS Employee
FROM Employee a
JOIN Employee b
ON a.managerId = b.id
WHERE a.salary > b.salary;
```
