# Intuition

When there are duplicate entries in a table (e.g., same email appearing multiple times),  
we need to keep only one unique record and remove the rest.  
The idea is to compare each row with every other row having the same value and delete the duplicate one with a higher `id`.

# Approach

We use a **self-join** on the same table.

- `e1` and `e2` represent two copies of the same table `Person`.
- The condition `e1.email = e2.email` ensures we’re comparing rows with the same email.
- The condition `e1.id > e2.id` ensures we delete the row with the higher `id`,  
  keeping the first occurrence (lowest `id`) for each unique email.

This way, duplicates are removed while one record per email remains.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** `O(n²)` — because of the self-join comparison for each pair of duplicates.
- **Space complexity:** `O(1)` — as no extra tables or structures are created.

# Code

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
DELETE e1
FROM Person e1
JOIN Person e2
ON e1.email = e2.email AND e1.id > e2.id;

```
