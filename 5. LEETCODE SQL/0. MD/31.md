# Intuition

To find all actor–director pairs that collaborated at least three times,  
we simply need to count how many times each unique `(actor_id, director_id)` pair appears in the table.  
If the count is 3 or more, it means they have cooperated frequently.

# Approach

1. Group the rows by both `actor_id` and `director_id` to treat each pair as a unit.
2. Count the number of occurrences for each pair using `COUNT(*)`.
3. Filter only those pairs where the count is **>= 3** using the `HAVING` clause.
4. Return the matching actor–director pairs.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  Grouping the entire table takes **O(n)** on average.
- **Space complexity:**  
  Requires only constant extra space → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT actor_id, director_id
FROM ActorDirector
GROUP BY actor_id, director_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;

```
