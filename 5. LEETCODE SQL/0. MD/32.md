# Intuition

We want to retrieve information from two related tables:

- the **sales** table containing `sales_id` and a `product_id` foreign key
- the **product** table containing `product_id` and `product_name`

To combine them, we need to join the tables on the matching `product_id` so each sale can be paired with its corresponding product name.

# Approach

Use a **JOIN** operation between the `sales` and `product` tables.

- `sales` is the main table because we want all sales.
- Use a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure we still return sales even if a product record is missing.
- Match rows based on `sales.product_id = product.product_id`.
- Select the `product_name` from the product table and the `sales_id` from the sales table.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  The join operation requires scanning both tables → **O(n)** on average.
- **Space complexity:**  
  The query uses no extra significant memory → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    s.sales_id
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN product p
    ON s.product_id = p.product_id;
```
