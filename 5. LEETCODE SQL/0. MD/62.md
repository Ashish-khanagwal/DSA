# Intuition

We need to find employees whose information is incomplete.  
An employee is considered to have missing information if either their **name** is missing or their **salary** is missing.  
Since the information is split across two tables, we must compare both tables and identify employee IDs that do not have matching records.

# Approach

1. Use a **LEFT JOIN** from `Employees` to `Salaries` to find employees who have a name but no salary.
2. Filter these rows by checking where `s.employee_id IS NULL`.
3. Use another **LEFT JOIN** from `Salaries` to `Employees` to find employees who have a salary but no name.
4. Filter these rows by checking where `e.employee_id IS NULL`.
5. Combine both result sets using `UNION` to include all employees with missing information.
6. Order the final result by `employee_id` in ascending order.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Each table is scanned once, so the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  The query uses minimal extra space aside from the result set → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT e.employee_id
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Salaries s
    ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
WHERE s.employee_id IS NULL

UNION

SELECT s.employee_id
FROM Salaries s
LEFT JOIN Employees e
    ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE e.employee_id IS NULL

ORDER BY employee_id;
```
