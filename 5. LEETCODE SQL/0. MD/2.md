# 🧠 Problem: Combine Person and Address Information

You are given two tables:

- **Person(personId, firstName, lastName)**
- **Address(addressId, personId, city, state)**

You need to write a query to return each person’s first name, last name, city, and state.  
If a person does not have an address, their city and state should appear as `NULL`.

## 💡 Intuition

Not every person in the database may have an address.  
To ensure we include **all people**, even those without address entries,  
we use a **LEFT JOIN** — which keeps all rows from the `Person` table,  
and matches address information where available.

---

## 🧩 Approach

1. Select columns from both tables — `firstName`, `lastName`, `city`, and `state`.
2. Join the two tables using **LEFT JOIN** on the common column `personId`.
   - `Person.personId = Address.personId`
3. A `LEFT JOIN` ensures that:
   - Every person appears in the result.
   - If a person has no matching record in the `Address` table,  
     `city` and `state` will show `NULL`.

## ⚙️ Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  Joins operate linearly with respect to the number of records in both tables (assuming indexes on `personId`).

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`  
  Only selected columns are fetched; no extra structures are used.

## 🧾 Code

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    firstName,
    lastName,
    city,
    state
FROM Person
LEFT JOIN Address
ON Person.personId = Address.personId;

```
