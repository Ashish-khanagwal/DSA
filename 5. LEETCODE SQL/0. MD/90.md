# Intuition

Each row in the table represents a **single working session** with its own `in_time` and `out_time`.  
If an employee enters and exits multiple times on the same day, we must count **all those sessions** to compute the total working time for that day.

So the idea is to calculate the time spent **per session** first and then **sum it up per employee per day**.

---

# Approach

1. **Compute session duration**
   - For every row, calculate `out_time - in_time` to get the duration of that session.

2. **Aggregate by employee and day**
   - Group the data by `emp_id` and `event_day`.
   - Use `SUM()` to add up all session durations for the same employee on the same day.

3. **Rename column**
   - Alias `event_day` as `day` to match the required output format.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  $$O(n)$$  
  Each record is processed once during aggregation.

- **Space complexity:**  
  $$O(1)$$ (excluding output)  
  No extra data structures are used.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    event_day AS day,
    emp_id,
    SUM(out_time - in_time) AS total_time
FROM Employees
GROUP BY event_day, emp_id;
```
