# Intuition

We want to find all patients who have the condition **DIAB1** listed in their medical records.  
The `conditions` column stores multiple conditions as a space-separated string, so a simple equality check will not work.  
Using a regular expression allows us to match **DIAB1** whether it appears at the beginning of the string or after a space.

# Approach

1. Select the required fields: `patient_id`, `patient_name`, and `conditions`.
2. Use a `REGEXP` pattern that matches:
   - `^DIAB1` → condition appears at the start, or
   - ` DIAB1` → condition appears after a space
3. The pattern `(^| )DIAB1` captures both of these cases.
4. Filter the table using this pattern.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Regex evaluation across all rows → **O(n)**
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Constant auxiliary space → **O(1)**

# Code

```mysql
SELECT patient_id, patient_name, conditions
FROM Patients
WHERE conditions REGEXP '(^| )DIAB1';
```
