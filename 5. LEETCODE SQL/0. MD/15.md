# Intuition

The problem asks us to find countries that are either very large in area or have a very large population. So, we simply need to filter the `World` table using logical conditions that check these thresholds.

# Approach

1. Select the relevant columns — `name`, `population`, and `area` — from the `World` table.
2. Use a `WHERE` clause with the logical operator `OR` to include:
   - Countries with an `area` greater than or equal to 3,000,000, **or**
   - Countries with a `population` greater than or equal to 25,000,000.
3. This ensures that any country meeting either of the two criteria is included in the result.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** O(n) — we scan through all records once to apply the filters.
- **Space complexity:** O(1) — filtering is done in place without extra data structures.

# Code

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World w
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
```
