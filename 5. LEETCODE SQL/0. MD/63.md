# Intuition

The task is to determine how many **unique subjects** each teacher teaches.  
Since the same teacher can appear multiple times for the same subject (possibly across different departments), simply counting rows would overcount.  
Therefore, we must count **distinct subject IDs** for each teacher.

# Approach

1. Group the table by `teacher_id` so that each teacher appears once in the result.
2. Use `COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id)` to count only unique subjects taught by each teacher.
3. Alias the result as `cnt` to represent the number of unique subjects per teacher.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Scanning the table and grouping by `teacher_id` takes **O(n)** time.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Uses constant extra space beyond the output → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    teacher_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id;
```
