# Intuition

The goal is to compute the final balance of each user based on all their transactions.  
Since each account starts with a balance of 0, we only need to sum all transaction amounts  
(positive = money received, negative = money sent).  
We then return only the users whose total balance exceeds 10,000.

# Approach

1. Join the `Users` and `Transactions` tables using the account number to associate each user with their transactions.
2. Use `SUM(t.amount)` to compute the total balance for each account.
3. Group the results by user to aggregate all transactions belonging to the same account.
4. Use `HAVING` to filter accounts with a total balance greater than 10,000.
5. Return the user name and calculated balance.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Aggregating all transactions for each user takes **O(n)** time, where _n_ is the number of rows in `Transactions`.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  The query uses only minimal aggregation memory → **O(1)** beyond the output size.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    u.name,
    SUM(t.amount) AS balance
FROM Users u
JOIN Transactions t
    ON u.account = t.account
GROUP BY u.account, u.name
HAVING SUM(t.amount) > 10000;
```
