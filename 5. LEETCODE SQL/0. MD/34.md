# Intuition

To find all sales that occurred in the first year each product was sold,  
we need to identify the **earliest year** for every product.  
Since the Sales table may contain multiple rows per product and year,  
we first compute the minimum year for each product, then extract the matching sales rows.

# Approach

1. **Group by product_id** and compute the **earliest sale year** using `MIN(year)`.
2. This gives a small table containing:  
   `product_id | first_year`.
3. **Join** this result back to the Sales table to retrieve the complete sales records  
   (quantity, price) that occurred in that first year.
4. Select the required fields and return the result.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:**
  - Computing MIN(year) per product → **O(n)**
  - Joining back with the Sales table → **O(n)**  
    Overall: **O(n)**
- **Space complexity:**  
  Only temporary storage for grouping → **O(1)**

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    s.product_id,
    s.year AS first_year,
    s.quantity,
    s.price
FROM Sales s
JOIN (
    SELECT product_id, MIN(year) AS first_year
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY product_id
) t
ON s.product_id = t.product_id
AND s.year = t.first_year;
```
