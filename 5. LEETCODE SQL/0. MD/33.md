# Intuition

To find the average experience of employees working on each project,  
we need to combine information from both the **Project** table and the **Employee** table.  
The Project table tells us which employees belong to each project, while the Employee table contains the corresponding experience years.  
Once we join the two tables, we can compute the average per project.

# Approach

1. Use the **Project** table as the base since the output is grouped by `project_id`.
2. Join the **Employee** table using the matching `employee_id` to access each employee’s experience.
3. Apply the `AVG()` aggregate function to compute the average experience for each project.
4. Use `ROUND(..., 2)` to format the result to 2 decimal places.
5. Group by `project_id` to ensure each project gets its own average.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  The join and group operation requires scanning all rows in the Project table → **O(n)**
- **Space complexity:**  
  The query uses only minimal extra space for aggregation → **O(1)**

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    p.project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM Project p
JOIN Employee e
    ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id;
```
