# Intuition

We want to find products that sold a total of at least 100 units, but only considering orders made in **February 2020**.  
Since units sold come from the Orders table and product names come from the Products table, we must join both tables and then aggregate the units per product.

# Approach

1. **Join** the Products and Orders tables based on `product_id` to access product names and sold units together.
2. **Filter** the Orders to include only those placed between `2020-02-01` and `2020-02-29`, i.e., February 2020.
3. **Group** the results by product to calculate the total units sold per product.
4. Use `SUM(o.unit)` to compute total units per product.
5. Apply a **HAVING** clause to keep only products with at least 100 units sold in that month.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The query performs a join, filtering, and grouping — overall **O(n)** where _n_ is the number of order records.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Uses constant extra space for the aggregation results → **O(1)** or **O(k)** for number of products returned.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    SUM(o.unit) AS unit
FROM Products p
JOIN Orders o
    ON p.product_id = o.product_id
WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2020-02-01' AND '2020-02-29'
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name
HAVING SUM(o.unit) >= 100;
```
