# Intuition

For each contest, we want to know what percentage of all users participated in it.  
This means comparing the number of **distinct users registered in a contest** with the **total number of users**.  
The result should be expressed as a percentage and rounded to two decimal places.

# Approach

1. Use the `Register` table to count how many **distinct users** registered for each contest.
2. Divide this count by the **total number of users** in the `Users` table.
3. Multiply by 100 to convert the ratio into a percentage.
4. Use `ROUND(..., 2)` to format the percentage to two decimal places.
5. Group the results by `contest_id`.
6. Order the output by percentage in descending order, and by `contest_id` in ascending order for ties.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Scanning the `Register` table and grouping by contest → **O(n)**  
  The subquery to count total users runs once → **O(1)**
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Uses constant extra space beyond the result set → **O(1)**

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    r.contest_id,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(DISTINCT r.user_id) * 100.0 /
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users), 2
    ) AS percentage
FROM Register r
GROUP BY r.contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, r.contest_id ASC;
```
