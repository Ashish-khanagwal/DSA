# Intuition

The task requires counting how many times each student has attended exams for every subject. Since not all students necessarily attend every subject, we need a structure that still produces rows for **all student–subject combinations**, even when no exam was taken.

# Approach

1. **Generate all student–subject pairs** using `CROSS JOIN`, ensuring every student is paired with every subject.
2. Use a **LEFT JOIN** between this pair and the `Examinations` table so that:
   - Matching exam entries are counted.
   - Missing exam entries still appear but with a count of zero.
3. Apply `COUNT(e.subject_name)` to count attended exams per student per subject.
4. Group by student and subject to compute aggregated exam counts.
5. Order the results by student ID and subject name for clear output formatting.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The `CROSS JOIN` produces `O(S × M)` rows (students × subjects), and joining with examinations remains efficient:  
  **O(n)** overall for grouping and counting.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Aside from intermediate join and grouping buffers, the space usage is constant: **O(1)** additional space.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name,
    sub.subject_name,
    COUNT(e.subject_name) AS attended_exams
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e
    ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name,
    sub.subject_name
ORDER BY
    s.student_id,
    sub.subject_name;
```
