# Intuition

To identify the customer who has placed the most orders, we need to count how many orders each customer has made. Once we have the total number of orders per customer, we can simply pick the one with the highest count.

# Approach

1. Use `GROUP BY` on `customer_number` to group all orders belonging to the same customer.
2. Use the aggregate function `COUNT(*)` to calculate how many orders each customer placed.
3. Sort the grouped results in descending order of the order count using `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC`.
4. Use `LIMIT 1` to select the customer with the maximum number of orders (since the problem guarantees only one such customer).

# Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  $$O(n \log n)$$ — The main cost comes from sorting the grouped results.
- Space complexity:  
  $$O(n)$$ — For storing the grouped intermediate results.

# Code

```mysql []
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT o.customer_number AS customer_number
FROM Orders o
GROUP BY o.customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
