# Intuition

To find numbers appearing at least three times consecutively, we can compare each row with the next two rows in sequence.  
If all three consecutive `num` values are the same, that number qualifies.

# Approach

We use **self-joins** on the same table three times (`l1`, `l2`, and `l3`) to access consecutive rows.  
By joining on consecutive `id` values (`l1.id = l2.id - 1` and `l2.id = l3.id - 1`),  
we ensure we are looking at three consecutive entries.  
Then, we check if the `num` values of these three rows are equal.  
Finally, `DISTINCT` ensures that each qualifying number appears only once in the result.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  $$O(n)$$ — each record is checked against the next two using joins.
- Space complexity:  
  $$O(1)$$ — only a few table aliases are used, no extra data structures.

# Code

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1
JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.id = l2.id - 1
JOIN Logs l3 ON l2.id = l3.id - 1
WHERE l1.num = l2.num AND l2.num = l3.num;
```
