# Intuition

To find the largest single number, we need to identify numbers that appear **exactly once** in the table.  
These are the “single numbers” as defined in the problem.  
Among these, the **largest** value is the answer.  
If no such number exists (i.e., all numbers occur more than once), we must return `NULL`.

# Approach

1. Use `GROUP BY num` to group identical numbers together.
2. Use `HAVING COUNT(*) = 1` to filter out only numbers that appear once.
3. Order the resulting numbers in **descending** order so the largest one comes first.
4. Use `LIMIT 1` to pick the largest single number.
5. Wrap this logic in a scalar subquery so the result is returned as a single-row, single-column output.
6. If no single number exists, the subquery returns no rows, and SQL outputs `NULL` as required.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  $$O(n \log n)$$  
  Due to `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  $$O(n)$$  
  Needed to store grouped values during aggregation.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    (SELECT num
     FROM MyNumbers
     GROUP BY num
     HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
     ORDER BY num DESC
     LIMIT 1) AS num;
```
