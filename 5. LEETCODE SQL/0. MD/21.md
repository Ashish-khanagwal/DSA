# Intuition

The task is to find all classes that have **at least five students**.  
This means we need to identify classes that appear five or more times in the `Courses` table, as each row represents a student enrolled in a class.

# Approach

1. Use `GROUP BY class` to group all students by their class.
2. Use the aggregate function `COUNT(*)` to count how many students belong to each class.
3. Apply a `HAVING` clause to filter only those classes where the count is greater than or equal to 5.
4. Select the class names that satisfy this condition.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  $$O(n)$$ — We scan the table once and group by class.
- **Space complexity:**  
  $$O(k)$$ — Where _k_ is the number of distinct classes stored during grouping.

# Code

```mysql []
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;
```
