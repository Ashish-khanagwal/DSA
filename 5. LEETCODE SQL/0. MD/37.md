# Intuition

The problem asks us to identify users who viewed their own articles.  
Each row in the `Views` table represents a view: who wrote the article (`author_id`) and who viewed it (`viewer_id`).  
If both values match, it means the author viewed their own content.  
We simply need to extract the distinct set of such authors.

# Approach

1. Scan the `Views` table to find rows where `author_id = viewer_id`.
2. This condition ensures the author is the same person as the viewer.
3. Select the `author_id` values that satisfy this and remove duplicates using `DISTINCT`.
4. Order the resulting IDs in ascending order for readability.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  A single table scan with filtering → **O(n)**
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Only stores the unique IDs in the output → **O(k)** where k is the number of qualified authors.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY id;
```
