# 🧠 Intuition

The goal is to compute **separate aggregates** for odd and even transaction amounts **per transaction date**.  
Since both values must be returned in the same row for each date, conditional aggregation is the most appropriate approach.

By evaluating whether each transaction amount is odd or even and summing accordingly, we can derive both metrics in a single grouped query.

# 🧩 Approach

1. **Group transactions by date**
   - Use `GROUP BY transaction_date` so each row in the output corresponds to one date.

2. **Use conditional aggregation**
   - Apply `CASE` expressions inside `SUM()`:
     - If `amount` is odd (`amount % 2 != 0`), add it to `odd_sum`
     - If `amount` is even (`amount % 2 = 0`), add it to `even_sum`
   - Use `ELSE 0` to ensure non-matching rows do not affect the sum.

3. **Order the results**
   - Sort by `transaction_date` in ascending order for readability.

# ⏱️ Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  $$O(n)$$  
  Each transaction row is scanned once and evaluated against constant-time conditions.

- **Space complexity:**  
  $$O(k)$$  
  Where `k` is the number of distinct `transaction_date` values in the result set.

# 💻 Code

```mysql
SELECT
    transaction_date,
    SUM(
        CASE WHEN amount % 2 != 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END
    ) AS odd_sum,
    SUM(
        CASE WHEN amount % 2 = 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END
    ) AS even_sum
FROM transactions
GROUP BY transaction_date
ORDER BY transaction_date;
```
