# Intuition

We need to filter users whose emails are valid and belong specifically to the **leetcode.com** domain.  
A valid email for this problem must:

1. Start with an alphabet (`a–z` or `A–Z`)
2. Contain only allowed characters before the `@`
3. End with `@leetcode.com`
4. Match case-sensitively for the domain part

# Approach

- Use a **REGEXP** pattern to validate the email format.
  - `^[a-zA-Z]` → must start with a letter
  - `[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*` → allowed characters before `@`
  - `@leetcode\.com$` → must end exactly with this domain
- Use `LIKE BINARY` to enforce **case sensitivity** on the domain part.
- Select the `user_id`, `name`, and `mail` of all users whose email matches the constraints.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Filtering using regex and LIKE over all rows → **O(n)**
- **Space Complexity:**  
  No extra data structures → **O(1)**

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    user_id,
    name,
    mail
FROM users
WHERE
    mail REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*@leetcode\\.com$'
    AND mail LIKE BINARY '%@leetcode.com';
```
