# Intuition

We need to standardize the format of user names so that each name starts with an uppercase letter followed by lowercase letters.  
Since names may be stored in inconsistent cases, we must transform the string accordingly while preserving the original order of users.

# Approach

1. Select the `user_id` to keep track of each user.
2. Use string functions to format the `name`:
   - `LEFT(name, 1)` extracts the first character.
   - `UPPER(...)` converts the first character to uppercase.
   - `SUBSTRING(name, 2)` extracts the remaining characters.
   - `LOWER(...)` converts the remaining characters to lowercase.
3. Concatenate the transformed parts using `CONCAT`.
4. Order the results by `user_id` to maintain consistent output.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Processing each user once and applying string operations → **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Only constant extra space is used for string manipulation → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    user_id,
    CONCAT(
        UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)),
        LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2))
    ) AS name
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_id;
```
