# Intuition

We need to identify tweets that exceed the allowed character limit.  
Each tweet’s text is stored in the `content` column, so checking its length directly tells us whether it violates the limit.

# Approach

1. Read each row from the `Tweets` table.
2. Use `CHAR_LENGTH(content)` to count the number of characters in the tweet content.
3. Filter out tweets whose character length is greater than 15.
4. Return only the `tweet_id` of those tweets.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Scanning all tweets and computing their lengths takes **O(n)**, where _n_ is the number of tweets.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  No additional data structures are used → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(content) > 15;
```
