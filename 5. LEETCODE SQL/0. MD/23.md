# Intuition

We need to find salespersons who **never made a sale to the company "RED"**. The key idea is to identify salespersons who **do have orders with "RED"** and then exclude them from the final result.

# Approach

1. Use a subquery to get all `sales_id` of salespersons who have orders with the company `"RED"`.
2. In the outer query, select all salespersons whose `sales_id` **is not in** that list.
3. This ensures we only get salespersons who **never had orders with "RED"**.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  $$O(n + m)$$  
  Where `n` is the number of rows in `SalesPerson` and `m` is the number of rows in `Orders`.

- Space complexity:  
  $$O(m)$$  
  For storing the intermediate list of `sales_id` from the subquery.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT s.name AS name
FROM SalesPerson s
WHERE s.sales_id NOT IN (
    SELECT o.sales_id
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Company c ON o.com_id = c.com_id
    WHERE c.name = 'RED'
);
```
