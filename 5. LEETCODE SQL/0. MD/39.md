# Intuition

We need to display every employee along with their corresponding unique identifier.  
Because not all employees have a unique ID, we must ensure that employees without a match still appear in the final result with `NULL` as their unique ID.  
This naturally suggests using a `LEFT JOIN`.

# Approach

1. Use the **Employees** table as the base since we must return **all** employees.
2. Perform a **LEFT JOIN** with the EmployeeUNI table on `id` so that:
   - If a matching unique ID exists, it will be returned.
   - If no matching entry exists, the unique_id will appear as `NULL`.
3. Select the required fields: `unique_id` and `name`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Joining two tables on a primary key is typically **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Uses constant extra space beyond the output → **O(1)** or **O(n)** for the result size.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    u.unique_id,
    e.name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI u
    ON e.id = u.id;
```
