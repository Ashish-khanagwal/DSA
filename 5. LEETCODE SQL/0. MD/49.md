# Intuition

The task requires summarizing daily product sales by counting how many unique products were sold on each date and listing those products in a clean, readable format. Since multiple entries can appear for the same product on the same day, we must ensure duplicates are removed.

# Approach

1. **Group by sell_date** so each date appears once in the output.
2. Use `COUNT(DISTINCT product)` to count the number of unique products sold on that date.
3. Use `GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ...)` to produce a comma-separated list of unique product names sorted alphabetically.
4. Output the aggregated information per date.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Grouping and scanning all rows requires **O(n)** time.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Requires temporary buffers for grouping and string concatenation → **O(n)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',') AS products
FROM Activities
GROUP BY sell_date;
```
