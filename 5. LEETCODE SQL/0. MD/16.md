# Intuition

The goal is to find managers who have at least five direct reports.  
Each employee record includes a `managerId` field that points to their manager's `id`.  
So, if a manager's `id` appears multiple times in the `managerId` column, that means they manage multiple employees.

# Approach

1. Use a subquery to find all `managerId`s that occur **five or more times** — this represents managers with at least five direct reports.
2. Use a `GROUP BY managerId` and `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5` to identify such managers.
3. Then, in the outer query, select the names of employees whose `id` matches any of those `managerId`s.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** O(n) — we scan the table once and perform grouping on `managerId`.
- **Space complexity:** O(n) — space used by the grouping operation.

# Code

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT e.name AS name
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.id IN (
    SELECT managerId
    FROM Employee
    WHERE managerID IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY managerID
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
);

```
