# 🧠 Intuition

The task is to compute **daily performance metrics per car make**.  
For each combination of `date_id` and `make_name`, we need to know:

- how many **unique leads** were generated, and
- how many **unique partners** were involved.

Since the requirement is to **summarize data** (not analyze individual rows), the problem is a classic case for **aggregation using `GROUP BY`** rather than window functions.

# 🧩 Approach

1. **Group the data**
   - Group rows by both `date_id` and `make_name` so that each output row represents one make on one date.

2. **Count unique values**
   - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT lead_id)` to count unique leads.
   - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT partner_id)` to count unique partners.
   - `DISTINCT` ensures duplicates are not double-counted.

3. **Order the result**
   - Sort by `date_id` and `make_name` to match the required output format.

# ⏱️ Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  $$O(n)$$  
  Each row is processed once during aggregation.

- **Space complexity:**  
  $$O(k)$$  
  Where `k` is the number of distinct `(date_id, make_name)` groups stored in the result.

# 💻 Code

```mysql
SELECT
    date_id,
    make_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT lead_id) AS unique_leads,
    COUNT(DISTINCT partner_id) AS unique_partners
FROM DailySales
GROUP BY date_id, make_name
ORDER BY date_id, make_name;
```
