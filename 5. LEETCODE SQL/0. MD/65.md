# Intuition

We need to identify users whose email addresses follow a strict format.  
The validation rules define exactly what characters are allowed before and after the `@` symbol and require the email to end with `.com`.  
Using a regular expression allows us to enforce all these constraints in a single condition.

# Approach

1. Select the required columns: `user_id` and `email`.
2. Use a `REGEXP` condition to validate the email format:
   - The part before `@` must contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
   - There must be exactly one `@` symbol.
   - The domain name (between `@` and `.com`) must contain only letters.
   - The email must end with `.com`.
3. Order the result by `user_id` as required.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Each email is checked once using a regular expression → **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  No extra space is used beyond the result set → **O(1)**.

# Code

```mysql
SELECT
    user_id,
    email
FROM Users
WHERE email REGEXP '^[A-Za-z0-9_]+@[A-Za-z]+\\.com$'
ORDER BY user_id;
```
