# Intuition

To find the second highest salary, we can think of it as the largest salary that is **less than** the maximum salary.  
Instead of sorting or using complex ranking, we can simply exclude the top salary and find the next maximum value.

# Approach

1. First, find the **highest salary** in the Employee table using `SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee`.
2. Then, find the **maximum salary that is less than** that highest salary.
3. This gives us the second highest salary directly without needing window functions or subqueries with ranking.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** `O(n)` — The query scans the table twice (once for the max and once for the next max).
- **Space complexity:** `O(1)` — No extra space is used apart from temporary variables in MySQL.

# Code

```mysql []
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);

```
