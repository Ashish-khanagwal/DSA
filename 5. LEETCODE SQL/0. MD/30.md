# Intuition

We need to find customers who purchased **every product** listed in the Product table.  
If the Product table contains _N_ unique products, a valid customer must have bought all _N_ of them.  
So for each customer, we count how many unique products they purchased and compare it with the total number of products.

# Approach

1. Group the Customer table by `customer_id`.
2. Count the number of **distinct** `product_key` values each customer purchased.
3. Compare this count with the **total number of products** in the Product table.
4. If both counts match, the customer bought every product.
5. Return these customer IDs.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Grouping + counting per customer → **O(n)**
  - Counting products once → **O(1)**  
    Overall: **O(n)**
- **Space Complexity:**  
  Uses constant extra space → **O(1)**

# Code

```mysql
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product
);
```
